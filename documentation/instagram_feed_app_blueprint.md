# Q

Please provide the steps involved in order to build a mobile application from scratch including the most popular 
libraries and easy ways to set up a development environment. The application should be written in a very popular 
javascript library. the application should be an instagram feed application that displays different components 
including stories, articles and story. The application code should also have a data page which includes 
articles, profile and stories.

# A

## Building an Instagram-like App Using React Native

Follow these steps to create an Instagram-like app using React Native:

### 1. Define the Concept and Design the UI

First, you should sketch the UI for your app, taking inspiration from the Instagram feed. This includes the 
Stories, Feed (Posts), and Profile page. Design tools like Figma or Sketch could be used for this.

### 2. Setting up the Development Environment

- Install Node.js and the Node Package Manager (npm).
- For Android development, install Android Studio for the Android Software Development Kit (SDK) and emulator.
- For iOS development, install Xcode.

### 3. Install React Native CLI

You can install React Native using npm:

```bash
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

### 4. Create a New Application

To create a new application, run the following command:

```bash
npx react-native init InstagramFeedApp
```

### 5. Running the Application

For iOS, use the following command to start your application:

```bash
npx react-native run-ios
```

For Android, use:

```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

### 6. Install Libraries

You will need some libraries to help in building the Instagram Feed App:

- `react-navigation`: for routing and navigation between screens.
- `axios`: for making API calls.
- `redux`: for state management.
- `react-redux`: for binding React with Redux.
- `redux-thunk`: for handling asynchronous logic within Redux.
- `react-native-elements`: for common interface elements like buttons and inputs.
- `react-native-vector-icons`: for displaying icons.

### 7. Building Your Application

Based on your specifications, you might want to consider the following structure for your application:

- `StoriesComponent`: This will be the component to display the stories. You can use a horizontal ScrollView to achieve the effect of scrolling through the stories horizontally.
- `FeedComponent`: This will be the component to display the feed or posts.
- `ProfileComponent`: This component will display the user profile information.
- `DataPage`: This page will include your `StoriesComponent`, `FeedComponent`, and `ProfileComponent`.

Here's a basic example of how you can structure your data and components:

```javascript
// Data
const userStories = [/* Array of user stories */];
const userPosts = [/* Array of user posts */];
const userProfile = {/* User profile data */};

// Components
function StoriesComponent({ stories }) { /* ... */ }
function FeedComponent({ posts }) { /* ... */ }
function ProfileComponent({ profile }) { /* ... */ }

// Main Page
function DataPage() {
  return (
    <View>
      <StoriesComponent stories={userStories} />
      <FeedComponent posts={userPosts} />
      <ProfileComponent profile={userProfile} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

You'd replace the comments and ellipses with your actual data and logic.

### 8. Test the Application

Testing is a vital part of software development. You can use libraries like Jest for unit testing and Detox for end-to-end testing.

### 9. Deploy the Application

Once the app is complete and thoroughly tested, it's time to deploy. For Android, you'll need to generate a signed APK. For iOS, you'll submit your app through Xcode to the App Store.

Remember, building an application is not a linear process. You'll likely go back and forth between these steps as you iterate on your design and functionality. Also, this is a very high-level overview. Each of these steps will require more detailed work.

# Q

please come up with a database in javascript object format that would include the following properties: articles 
which would be an array that would contain objects and each object would have an id, avatar, name, image, likes, 
commentsCount, comments.Aadd 5 different objects in the array of articles.

# A

Sure, here is an example of a JavaScript object database with the structure you requested. It represents a collection of articles, where each article has an ID, avatar, name, image, likes, commentsCount, and comments. The `comments` attribute is an array of objects itself, each having an ID, user, and text.

```javascript
const database = {
  articles: [
    {
      id: 1,
      avatar: "avatar1.png",
      name: "Article 1",
      image: "image1.png",
      likes: 10,
      commentsCount: 2,
      comments: [
        { id: 1, user: "User1", text: "This is a comment." },
        { id: 2, user: "User2", text: "This is another comment." },
      ],
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      avatar: "avatar2.png",
      name: "Article 2",
      image: "image2.png",
      likes: 20,
      commentsCount: 1,
      comments: [
        { id: 1, user: "User3", text: "This is a comment." },
      ],
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      avatar: "avatar3.png",
      name: "Article 3",
      image: "image3.png",
      likes: 30,
      commentsCount: 0,
      comments: [],
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      avatar: "avatar4.png",
      name: "Article 4",
      image: "image4.png",
      likes: 40,
      commentsCount: 3,
      comments: [
        { id: 1, user: "User4", text: "This is a comment." },
        { id: 2, user: "User5", text: "This is another comment." },
        { id: 3, user: "User6", text: "This is yet another comment." },
      ],
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      avatar: "avatar5.png",
      name: "Article 5",
      image: "image5.png",
      likes: 50,
      commentsCount: 0,
      comments: [],
    },
  ],
};
```

This object represents a static "snapshot" of a database and doesn't include methods to manipulate the data (like adding or removing articles, likes or comments). To interact with the data, you could use JavaScript's array methods or build custom functions. Remember that this data format is good for a simple application or a mockup, but for a real application, you would typically use a database system to store your data.

# Q

Could you use realistic names please?

# A

Certainly! Here's a revised version of the previous JavaScript object database, this time using more realistic names and avatar/image URLs:

```javascript
const database = {
  articles: [
    {
      id: 1,
      avatar: "https://example.com/avatar/john_doe.png",
      name: "The Future of Tech",
      image: "https://example.com/article_images/future_of_tech.png",
      likes: 200,
      commentsCount: 2,
      comments: [
        { id: 1, user: "Alice", text: "Great insights about the future of technology!" },
        { id: 2, user: "Bob", text: "I'm looking forward to these developments." },
      ],
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      avatar: "https://example.com/avatar/jane_doe.png",
      name: "AI in Healthcare",
      image: "https://example.com/article_images/ai_healthcare.png",
      likes: 350,
      commentsCount: 1,
      comments: [
        { id: 1, user: "Charlie", text: "This is a breakthrough for medical science!" },
      ],
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      avatar: "https://example.com/avatar/michael_scott.png",
      name: "Sustainable Energy",
      image: "https://example.com/article_images/sustainable_energy.png",
      likes: 1000,
      commentsCount: 0,
      comments: [],
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      avatar: "https://example.com/avatar/emma_watson.png",
      name: "Virtual Reality",
      image: "https://example.com/article_images/virtual_reality.png",
      likes: 780,
      commentsCount: 3,
      comments: [
        { id: 1, user: "David", text: "Can't wait for the next-gen VR devices!" },
        { id: 2, user: "Eva", text: "VR is definitely the future of entertainment." },
        { id: 3, user: "Frank", text: "Very interesting article. Thank you for sharing." },
      ],
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      avatar: "https://example.com/avatar/elon_musk.png",
      name: "Space Exploration",
      image: "https://example.com/article_images/space_exploration.png",
      likes: 3000,
      commentsCount: 0,
      comments: [],
    },
  ],
};
```

Note that I've replaced avatar and image paths with placeholder URLs. You would replace these with the actual URLs for your avatars and images. Also, user comments are made up and should be replaced with actual user comments from your application.

# Q

Given the following code what is an efficient way to display  items in a scrollable list view in react native  
(please focus on the data articles objects specifically the likes, comments and name):

```javascript
import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import database from './instagram-feed/data';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>name: {database.articles[1].name}</Text>
      <Text>likes: {database.articles[1].likes}</Text>
      <Text>comments: {database.articles[2].comments}</Text>
      <Text>commentsCount: {database.articles[1].commentsCount}</Text>
      <StatusBar style="auto" />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});
```
# A

React Native provides a `FlatList` or `ScrollView` component which is useful for displaying a scrolling list of data. You can map each article to a JSX element inside this list. Here's how you can do it:

First, import `FlatList` from React Native.

```javascript
import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, FlatList } from 'react-native';
import database from './instagram-feed/data';
```

Then, you can replace your render function with a `FlatList` component:

```javascript
export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <FlatList
        data={database.articles}
        keyExtractor={item => item.id.toString()}
        renderItem={({ item }) => (
          <View style={styles.itemContainer}>
            <Text>Name: {item.name}</Text>
            <Text>Likes: {item.likes}</Text>
            <Text>CommentsCount: {item.commentsCount}</Text>
            <Text>Comments: </Text>
            {item.comments.map((comment, index) => (
              <Text key={index}>{comment.user}: {comment.text}</Text>
            ))}
          </View>
        )}
      />
      <StatusBar style="auto" />
    </View>
  );
}
```

I've also added a new style for the individual item containers:

```javascript
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  itemContainer: {
    flex: 1,
    borderBottomWidth: 1, // Add border
    borderBottomColor: '#000', // Add border color
    padding: 10,
    margin: 10,
  },
});
```

`FlatList` is a more efficient way to render a long list in comparison with using the `map()` method because `FlatList` only renders the items currently visible on the screen (and not all items at once), which improves performance for long lists.

In this code:

- `data` prop is where we pass in our articles data.
- `keyExtractor` prop is used to uniquely identify our elements. We use each article's `id` for this. We convert it to a string as the key should be of string type.
- `renderItem` prop is where we tell the FlatList how to render each item. It gives us access to the current item in `item`. We use destructuring to pull the `item` out of the current object.

Within `renderItem`, we are rendering each `item` in a `View` and displaying the `name`, `likes`, `commentsCount` and individual `comments` in `Text` components. 

`item.comments.map()` is used to display each comment from the `comments` array. Here `comment.user` is the user who made the comment and `comment.text` is the comment's text.

# Q

Given the following code update the comments key value dynamically with the commentsCount value of each object 
in the articles array and return the new data in a new variable called data:

```javascript
const database = {
  profile: {avatar: "../assets/images/avatars/1.jpg"},

  stories: [
    {
      id: 1,
      avatar: "../assets/images/avatars/1.jpg",
      name: "The Future of Tech",
      isSeen: false,
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      avatar: "../assets/images/avatars/2.jpg",
      name: "AI in Healthcare",
      isSeen: false,
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      avatar: "../assets/images/avatars/3.jpg",
      name: "Sustainable Energy",
      isSeen: true,
    },
  ],
  articles: [
    {
      id: 1,
      avatar: "../assets/images/avatars/1.jpg",
      name: "The Future of Tech",
      image: "../assets/images/posts/1.jpg",
      likes: 200,
      commentsCount: 0,
      comments: 'View all 0 comments',
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      avatar: "../assets/images/avatars/2.jpg",
      name: "AI in Healthcare",
      image: "../assets/images/posts/2.jpg",
      likes: 350,
      commentsCount: 0,
      comments: 'View all 0 comments',
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      avatar: "../assets/images/avatars/3.jpg",
      name: "Sustainable Energy",
      image: "../assets/images/posts/3.jpg",
      likes: 1000,
      commentsCount: 0,
      comments: 'View all 0 comments',
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      avatar: "../assets/images/avatars/4.jpg",
      name: "Virtual Reality",
      image: "../assets/images/posts/4.jpg",
      likes: 780,
      commentsCount: 0,
      comments: 'View all 0 comments',
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      avatar: "../assets/images/avatars/5.jpg",
      name: "Space Exploration",
      image: "../assets/images/posts/5.jpg",
      likes: 3000,
      commentsCount: 0,
      comments: 'View all 0 comments',
    },
  ],
};

export default database;
```
# A

To achieve this, we will need to use the JavaScript `map` function on the `articles` array and change the `comments` property for each article to reflect the `commentsCount`:

```javascript
const data = {
  ...database,
  articles: database.articles.map(article => ({
    ...article,
    comments: `View all ${article.commentsCount} comments`,
  })),
};
```

This code first creates a new object (`data`) that is a copy of the `database` object. Then, for the `articles` property of this new object, it maps through each article in the `database.articles` array. For each article, it creates a new object that is a copy of the current article, and changes the `comments` property to reflect the `commentsCount` value.

The `${article.commentsCount}` syntax is a JavaScript feature called template literals. It allows you to embed expressions (like variables) within string literals.

Also, remember to add the `export default data;` line at the end of your file if you want to make this new `data` object available for importing into other files in your project.
